# Example parallax website

This website is made in basic HTML using SCSS.

## What is parallax?

Parallax scrolling is a special scrolling technique used in web design where images throughout a web page move slower than foreground images, 
creating an illusion of depth on a two-dimensional site.

This basic website showcases a simple approach to have two images moving on mouse hovering, creating an interactive experience.
